        <h2>Pyramids of GIZA</h2>
        <p>The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that. The monumental tombs are relics of <span>Egypt's
                Old Kingdom era</span> and were constructed some 4,500 years ago.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Pharaoh Khufu</b> began the first Giza pyramid project, circa 2550 B.C. His Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza and
            towers some 481 feet (147 meters) above the plateau. Its estimated 2.3 million stone blocks each weigh an average of
            2.5 to 15 tons.</p>
        <p>Khufu's son, Pharaoh Khafre, built the second pyramid at Giza, circa 2520 B.C. His necropolis also included the Sphinx, a mysterious limestone monument with the body of a lion and a pharaoh's head. The <span>Sphinx</span> may stand sentinel for the pharaoh's entire tomb complex.</p>
